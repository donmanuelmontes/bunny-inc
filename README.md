# bunny-inc â€” Now Playing Prototype

This project is an application prototype from Bunny Inc.

## Tools/Frameworks used

* For Front-End Framework I used Angular JS, mostly for its ease of use and robustness for data binding.
* Also the CSS Framework: Bootstrap, for its easy layout options and good visual presentation.
* Bower for taking care of finding, downloading, and saving the packages the project needs. 
* Socket.Io to emit and receive custom events, from Node JS to Angular JS.
* Twit is a Twitter API Client for Node JS
